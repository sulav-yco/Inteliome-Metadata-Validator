    description: eoh (end of hand) refers to inventory quantities organized by each item within specific locations and on specified dates. when discussing 'eoh' for a particular timeframe, such as 'january 2021' or 'week 3, 2021,' it specifically denotes the exact inventory quantity at the conclusion of that period, typically referencing the 'inventory_onhand_quantity' column in data warehouses or inventory management systems. for example, 'eoh of january 2021' represents the inventory count as of january 31, 2021, while 'eoh of week 3, 2021' indicates the inventory quantity at the end of the third week of 2021. similarly, 'eoh of 2021' signifies the inventory amount on december 31, 2021. it's important to note that the 'sum' aggregate function isn't universally applicable across this time hierarchy, necessitating separate calculations for each period's inventory quantity.
